### RFID Transaction Management System

This project is a simple RFID transaction management system built with PHP and SQLite. It allows users to upload transaction data and view all transactions in a web interface.

## Directory Structure



## File Descriptions

- **upload.php**: This script handles the uploading of RFID transaction data via a POST request. It validates the input data and saves the transaction using the `RFIDManager` class.

- **index.php**: This script displays all RFID transactions in a table format. It fetches transactions from the `RFIDManager` and renders them in an HTML table.

- **info.php**: This script outputs the PHP configuration information. It can be accessed to check the PHP environment settings.

- **RFIDManager.php**: This class manages RFID transactions, including saving and retrieving them from the SQLite database. It initializes the database table if it doesn't exist.

- **DatabaseManager.php**: This class handles the database connection for the application, providing a method to get the SQLite database connection.

- **Requestmaker.py**: This Python script is used to send a POST request to the `upload.php` script with sample transaction data. It can be used for testing the upload functionality.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up a local server (e.g., XAMPP, MAMP) to run the PHP files.
3. Place the `php_program` directory in the server's document root.
4. Access the `index.php` file through your web browser to view transactions.

## Usage

### Uploading a Transaction

To upload a transaction, you can use the `Requestmaker.py` script or a cURL command. Hereâ€™s how to construct the cURL command:

```
curl -X POST -d "customer=Jean Baptiste&initial_balance=100000&transport_fare=2000" http://localhost/php_program/embedded/upload.php
```

- **-X POST**: Specifies that the request method is POST.
- **-d**: Sends the specified data in the POST request. In this case, it includes:
  - `customer`: The name of the customer (e.g., "Jean Baptiste").
  - `initial_balance`: The initial balance of the customer (e.g., 100000).
  - `transport_fare`: The transport fare to be deducted (e.g., 2000).
- **http://localhost/php_program/embedded/upload.php**: The URL of the `upload.php` script where the request is sent.

### Viewing Transactions

To view all transactions, simply access the `index.php` file in your web browser:

```
http://localhost/php_program/embedded/index.php
```

### Testing with Python Script

You can also run the `Requestmaker.py` script to test the upload functionality. Make sure you have the `requests` library installed in Python:

```
pip install requests
```

Then run the script:

```bash
python Requestmaker.py
```
